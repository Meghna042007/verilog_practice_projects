# Digital_Circuits_Verilog

This repository contains a collection of Verilog HDL modules and testbenches for practicing digital design and simulation. Each folder includes a self-contained project focusing on specific digital logic components.

##  Structure

Each folder in this repository typically includes:
- A Verilog module (`.v` file)
- A corresponding testbench
- Optional notes or diagrams

Projects are organized by topic but remain independent of each other.

##  Tools Used

- **Vivado / XSIM** – for simulation and waveform viewing
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and project management

##  Key Concepts Practiced

- Combinational and sequential logic
- Structural and behavioral Verilog
- Simulation and verification using testbenches
- Modular, reusable design practices

##  Goals

- Strengthen understanding of digital design fundamentals
- Gain hands-on experience with Verilog HDL
- Build a personal portfolio of working modules
- Improve debugging and simulation workflow
